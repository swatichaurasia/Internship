## Task1 : Prediction using Supervised ML
What is Supervised Machine Learning?
- It is defined as use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the model, it adjusts its weights until the model has been fitted appropriately, which occurs as part of the cross validation process. Supervised learning helps solve for a variety of real-world problems at scale, etc.

How supervised learning works?
- Supervised learning uses a training set to teach models to yield the desired output. This training dataset includes inputs and correct outputs, which allow the model to learn over time. The algorithm measures its accuracy through the loss function, adjusting until the error has been sufficiently minimized.

Supervised Learning can be categorised into:
1. Classification - It uses an algorithm to accurately assign test data into specific categories. It recognizes specific entities within the dataset and attempts to draw some conclusions on how those entities should be labeled or defined. Common classification algorithms are linear classifiers, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, and random forest.
2. Regression - It is used to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables. It is commonly used to make projections, such as for sales revenue for a given business.

## Task2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML
What is unsupervised Machine Learning?
- It is defined as  a machine learning technique in which models are not supervised using training dataset. Instead, models itself find the hidden patterns and insights from the given data.
